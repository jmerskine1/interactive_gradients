# interactive_gradients
An Interactive Human-Machine Learning Interface for Collecting and Learning from Complex Annotations

Welcome to the code repo for the interactive gradients tool described in our paper:
- preprint: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19339
- IJCAI Demo: [I will add a link to the IJCAI demo paper once it has been published].

To run the code, install the necessary libraries:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
